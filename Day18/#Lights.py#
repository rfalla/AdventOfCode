# Day 18
# Santa gives you a lighting plan for a 100x100 grid
# "#" means on
# "." means off
# succesive steps are taken by counting the number of on lights around a light
# For on lights: stay on if 2 or 3 neighbours are lit; off otherwise
# For off lights: turn on if 3 neighbours are on; off otherwise
# update happens simultaneously
# find out how many lights are on after 100 iterations
